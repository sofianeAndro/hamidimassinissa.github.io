#Project description
The project is a gas detection system using a gas sensor to detect a quantity of gas, in the beginning a green led is lit, as soon as it reaches the threshold, the system starts operating starting with the closing of the valve, an alarm is triggered, a red led is lit, the green one is tuned off and a fan will turn on. In order to view the gas rate instantly, we use a developed Android application that is used to display the recovered data by transmitting via a bluetooth module.

#Hardware parts used
*Arduino Uno R3
*MQ2 sensor
*DC motor (for fan)
*Servo-motor (for valve)
*Passive Buzzer
*LEDs (red & green)
*Bluetooth module

#Developed software
*Android application (IOT-Data collection)
